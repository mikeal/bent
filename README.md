Functional HTTP client for Node.js and Browsers with async/await.

*Incredibly small browser version built on fetch with no external dependencies or polyfills.*

## Usage

```javascript
const bent = require('bent')

const getJSON = bent('json')
const getBuffer = bent('buffer')

let obj = await getJSON('http://site.com/json.api')
let buffer = await getBuffer('http://site.com/image.png')
```

As you can see, bent is a function that returns an async function.

Bent takes options which constrain what is accepted by the client.
Any response that falls outside the constraints will generate an error.

You can provide these options in any order, and Bent will figure out which option is which by inspecting the option's type and content.
```javascript
const post = bent('http://localhost:3000/', 'POST', 'json', 200);
const response = await post('cars/new', {name: 'bmw', wheels: 4});
```

If you don't set a response encoding (`'json'`, `'string'` or `'buffer'`)
then the *native* response object will be returned after the statusCode check.

In Node.js, we also add decoding methods that match the Fetch API (`.json()`,
`.text()` and `.arrayBuffer()`).

```javascript
const bent = require('bent')

const getStream = bent('http://site.com')

let stream = await getStream('/json.api')
// status code
stream.status // 200
stream.statusCode // 200
// optionally decode
const obj = await stream.json()
// or
const str = await stream.text()
```

The following options are available.

* **HTTP Method**: `'GET'`, `'PUT'`, or any other ALLCAPS string will be
  used to set the HTTP method. Defaults to `'GET'`.
* **Response Format**: Available formats are `'string'`, `'buffer'`, and
  `'json'`. By default, the response object/stream will be returned instead
  of a decoded response. *Browser returns `ArrayBuffer` instead of `Buffer`.*
* **Status Codes**: Any number will be considered an acceptable status code.
  By default, `200` is the only acceptable status code. When any status codes
  are provided, `200` must be included explicitly in order to be acceptable.
* **Headers**: An object can be passed to set request headers.
* **Base URL**: Any string that begins with 'https:' or 'http:' is
  considered the Base URL. Subsequent queries need only pass the remaining
  URL string.
* **Agent**: _(nodejs only)_ An object representing an
  [http.Agent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)
  may be passed.  It will be used instead of the default
  [http.globalAgent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)
  that is generally used.  See the section below on proxying.  Obviously an
  [https.Agent](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent)
  may be used for https: connections.

The returned async function is used for subsequent requests.

When working with Binary this library uses different types in the browser and Node.js. In Node.js all binary must be done
using the `Buffer` type. In the browser you can use ArrayBuffer or any ArrayBuffer view type (UInt8Array, etc).

### `async request(url[, body=null, headers={}])`

* **url**: Fully qualified URL to the remote resource, or in the case that a
  base URL is passed the remaining URL string.
* **body**: Request body. Can be a string, a stream (node.js), a buffer (node.js) (see note below),
  an ArrayBuffer (browser), or a JSON object.
* **headers**: An object of any headers you need to set for just this request.

```javascript
const bent = require('bent')

const put = bent('PUT', 201)
await put('http://site.com/upload', Buffer.from('test'))
```

Or


```javascript
const bent = require('bent')

const put = bent('PUT', 201, 'http://site.com')
await put('/upload', Buffer.from('test')) 
```

### Proxying

bent does not, of itself, handle http proxies.  However it is possible to
pass in an `http.Agent` object to the nodejs version
which can proxy on bent's behalf.

[node-tunnel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tunnel) seems to work well
and has been tested with bent, proxying to [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)
on the local machine.  It can be set up as follows:

```javascript
const bent = require('bent')
const tunnel = require('tunnel')
const agent = tunnel.httpsOverHttp({
  proxy: {
    port: 8888
    },
  ca: fs.readFileSync('<path to charles-proxy-ssl-proxying-certificate.pem>')
})
const get = bent('GET', 'http://site.com', agent)
await get('/myfile.txt')
```

### NOTE

If the `body` is passed as an `object`, it will be treated
as JSON, stringified and the `Content-Type` will be set to `application/json`
unless already set.  A common requirement is to POST using `form-urlencoded`.
This will require you to set the `Content-Type` header to
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and to encode the body yourself,
perhaps using
[form-urlencoded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-urlencoded).
